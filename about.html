            <h2 class="artistName">Artist, Owner Gibson's Glass</h2>
            <p><span class="emphsis">Krista Gibson</span> is inspired by the nature of Victoria Beach and likes to create art with glass and other local materials. Her art has no boundaries. She creates stained glass panels and even includes vintage dishes, bringing new life to the past, or fused glass landscapes with a birchbark setting.</p>
            <p>
              Krista fell in love with glass as an art form just over six years ago. It began with a few evening classes on the medium to help drive away the winter blues, but after creating her first few pieces, she was hooked! With her love to draw and create something different and unique each time.</p>
              <p>Krista's favorite creations include a backlit sunset beach ukelele; a cross-country skier in a snowshoe frame; and upcycled vintage candy and pickle dishes to create something truly distinctive. Saving every scrap of glass from her creations, Krista repurposes these for ornaments, greeting cards and mosaics on upcycled doors and windows.</p>

        <p class="about__fullWidth--content">A couple of years ago Krista began experimenting with fused glass, this opened more opportunities for creativity. Creating fused glass windchimes and picturesque beach and lake scenes inspired by Lake Winnipeg. With birchbark or pen and ink wave settings, her creations are truly one of a kind. Krista's goal is to continue to recycle and upcycle, mix glass mediums, and create something no one has seen before!</p>

          <strong>Gibson's Glass & Art</strong> specializes in commission-based projects in both stained glass and fused glass décor. Custom designs are a huge part of my business & I am always accepting requests.
        </p>

          Once a design is selected and colour pallet is discussed, I will create a drawing and share the final design before work begins. At this time, I will also provide pricing and timing for the completion of your custom piece! There are hundreds of glass styles and colours to choose from. When selecting glass, I always try to select glass that complements the design. Once all materials are agreed upon, the building process takes place. During construction, I will share progress photos with you. The timeframe for construction will be agreed upon during the signing of the estimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the factors that impact pricing are the following: Complexity of design, Size of the overall piece, Construction style, Type of glass

        <h2>Stained Glass</h2>
        <p class="stainedGlassHead">
          Stained Glass is created using the L.C. Tiffany method of copper foil, has an antique patina finish on the solder & the entire piece is protected with a high quality polish. Panel is framed in a zinc frame & is very sturdy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cleaning Stained Glass:</strong> Minimal cleaning is recommended, wipe clean with a soft, slightly damp cloth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solder and came <em>(framing)</em> contain lead: be sure to wash your hands after handling.
        </p>
        <p>
          All future cleanings should be done with a dry cotton cloth or microfiber towel. If need be, the glass cleaner. Please be cautious cleaning around painted details; avoid if you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most glass I use is no longer in production or was salvaged from other stained glass studios and decades-owned suppliers. Due to the nature of the glass' age, slight surface imperfections <em>(like fine scratches and markings)</em> are possible — these marks do not affect the integrity or value of the stained glass piece. I do my best to reuse and repurpose glass, even if it has minor imperfections, each sheet of glass is thoroughly inspected used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suction cups frequently fail! I recommend hanging your piece from a sturdy hook or latch screwed into the window frame.
        </p>
        <h2>Fused Glass</h2>
        <p>
          Fused glass art is created using fusible glass, frit, powders and paint, then placed into a kiln for firing at high temperatures ranging between 1300F - 1500F. By layering the glass, unique textures and designs can be created.
        </p>
        <p>
          All future cleanings can be done with a damp cloth and mild detergent.
        </p>
        <h2>Vintage Dishes Upcycled Stained Glass</h2>
        <p>
          Not sure what to do with all those dishes you inherited and are collected dust in the China cabinet? Why not keep the memories alive by having a custom panel piece created for you to enjoy everyday?
        </p>
        <p>
          These stained glass panels are created using vintage serving platters, candy and pickle plates. The dishes are first fused flat in the kiln, firing up to 1400F for approximately 9hrs and then imported into the design using Stained glass Tiffany method of copper foil, has an antique patina finish on the solder & the entire piece is protected with a high quality polish. Panel is framed in a zinc frame & is very sturdy.
